# RoguelikeRust

## Project Idea
i wanted to learn rust and if im learning it im doing it the fun way. I decided to get inspired by a coding tutorial where they make a roguelike in rust so i wanted to do my own. (tutorial from: https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/). Also i wanted to do a roguelike that is inspired by steampunky magic like bioshock, dishonored and so on (image generated by ChatGPT) ![](images/20241205111648.png)

 **Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Title Screen Display**:
   - The game opens with a title screen that has the following options:
     - "Start New Game"
     - "Load Game" (if implemented)
     - "Quit"
   - The "Start New Game" option is highlighted by default.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - Pressing the appropriate key (e.g., Enter, or clicking "Start New Game") initiates a new game.

3. **Game Initialization**:
   - A new dungeon is generated procedurally when the player starts a new game.
   - The player character is placed at a valid starting position (e.g., a random room or specific tile).

4. **Dungeon Rendering**:
   - The first dungeon level is displayed on the screen immediately after selecting "Start New Game."
   - Walls, floors, and other dungeon elements are rendered visibly and clearly distinguishable.

5. **Player Feedback**:
   - The player sees their character (e.g., an avatar or symbol like "@") on the dungeon map upon game start.
   - The game log (if implemented) displays an initial message (e.g., "You enter the dungeon...").

6. **Game State**:
   - Starting a new game resets any previous progress or saves.
   - A new random seed is used for dungeon generation (if procedural generation is used).

7. **Error Handling**:
   - If the game encounters an issue during initialization, an appropriate error message is displayed, and the player is returned to the title screen.
